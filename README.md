## Getting Started
* 
* [Download the installer](https://nodejs.org/) for Node LTS.
* Install the angular CLI globally: `npm install -g @angular/cli`
* Install the ionic CLI globally: `npm install -g @ionic/cli`
* Run `npm install` from the project root.

_Note: See [How to Prevent Permissions Errors](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions) if you are running into issues when trying to install packages globally._


## Running
* Run `ionic serve` in a terminal from the project root.
* Get the local host and port from terminal outputs and open in browser. (Chrome is convenient)
* Open developer tools in browser, toggle device toolbar to see mobile view (⌘+⇧+M on Mac)
* Change selected device there and reload the page to see how does it look for that one.


## Deploying

Mobile deployment process is well described in [official documentation](https://ionicframework.com/docs/angular/your-first-app/deploying-mobile) (use CAPACITOR)
